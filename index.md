Hi there! I'm Miranda (she/her).

### About me

I'm a PhD student at the University of Washington; [Franzi Roesner](https://www.franziroesner.com) and [Yoshi Kohno](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yoshi/index.html) are my co-advisors. [My research](./publications) focuses on the usability of computer security and privacy. I'm especially interested in how average users imagine, interact with, and are influenced by technology. Generally, I love asking people about what they love, what they hate, and anything else they feel strongly about.

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked with [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com) at the University of Chicago.

I was born and raised in Chicago (unless you're from the city, in which case I was born and raised in the suburbs). I studied political science and computer science during my undergraduate degree, and graduated in June 2017.

I now live in Seattle where I spend lots of time hiding from the rain with my two cats.
