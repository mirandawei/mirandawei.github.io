Hi there! I'm Miranda (she/they).

### About me

I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Washington, where I am co-advised by [Franzi Roesner](https://www.franziroesner.com) and [Yoshi Kohno](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yoshi/index.html). In [my research](./publications), I am interested in investigating security and privacy from the perspective of contemporary sociocultural lenses (e.g., gender, interpersonal relationships) and new technologies (e.g., TikTok). Generally, I love asking people about what they love, what they hate, and anything else they feel strongly about.

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked with [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com) at the University of Chicago. Some of my research from those years investigated privacy perceptions of online advertising as well as password and security notification usability.

I was born and raised in Chicago (unless you're from the city, in which case I was born and raised in the suburbs). I studied political science and computer science during my undergraduate degree, and graduated in June 2017.

I now live in Seattle where I spend lots of time hiding from the rain with my two cats.
