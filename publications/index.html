It began with a US-centric lens on issues primarily affecting privileged Western populations in corporate settings, such as authentication or online privacy controls. The field expands as it claims more security and privacy issues under its domain. From the perspective of this field, the existence and study of “other” user populations and their distinct threat models has been a place for discovery. This transition – even if unintended by individual researchers – shares imperial tendencies in its expansionist and subjugationist character. The first step to mitigating these tendencies is identifying how they affect security and privacy research in HCI. Our work characterizes manifestations of imperialism in human-centered security, privacy and safety research, and offers anti-imperialist research principles. Doing so enables research to work towards the safety of all people.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="gilbert2025tiktok" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">"TikTok, Do Your Thing”: User Reactions to Social Surveillance in the Public Sphere</div> <div class="author"> Meira Gilbert, <em>Miranda Wei</em>, and Lindah Kotut </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS)</em>, Aug 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.5555/3767870.3767888" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20884" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20884" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>“TikTok, Do Your Thing” is a viral trend where users attempt to identify strangers they see in public via information crowd-sourcing. The trend started as early as 2021 and users typically engage with it for romantic purposes (similar to a “Missed Connections” personal advertisement). This practice includes acts of surveillance and identification in the public sphere, although by peers rather than governments or corporations. To understand users’ reactions to this trend we conducted a qualitative analysis of 60 TikTok videos and 1,901 user comments. Of the 60 videos reviewed, we find 19 individuals were successfully identified. We also find that while there were comments expressing disapproval (n=310), more than double the number expressed support (n=883). Supportive comments demonstrated genuine interest and empathy, reflecting evolving conceptions of community and algorithmic engagement. On the other hand, disapproving comments highlighted concerns about inappropriate relationships, stalking, consent, and gendered double standards. We discuss these insights in relation to the normalization of interpersonal surveillance, online stalking, and as an evolution of social surveillance to offer a new perspective on user perceptions surrounding interpersonal surveillance and identification in the public sphere.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="wei2025sncei" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">"We’re utterly ill-prepared to deal with something like this": Teachers’ Perspectives on Student Generation of Synthetic Nonconsensual Explicit Imagery</div> <div class="author"> <em>Miranda Wei</em>, Christina Yeung, Franziska Roesner, and Tadayoshi Kohno </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</em>, Apr 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3706598.3713226" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/chi25.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Synthetic nonconsensual explicit imagery, also referred to as “deepfake nudes”, is becoming faster and easier to generate. In the last year, synthetic nonconsensual explicit imagery was reported in at least ten US middle and high schools, generated by students of other students. Teachers are at the front lines of this new form of image abuse and have a valuable perspective on threat models in this context. We interviewed 17 US teachers to understand their opinions and concerns about synthetic nonconsensual explicit imagery in schools. No teachers knew of it happening at their schools, but most expected it to be a growing issue. Teachers proposed many interventions, such as improving reporting mechanisms, focusing on consent in sex education, and updating technology policies. However, teachers disagreed about appropriate consequences for students who create such images. We unpack our findings relative to differing models of justice, sexual violence, and sociopolitical challenges within schools.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="wei2024understanding" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Understanding Help-Seeking and Help-Giving on Social Media for Image-Based Sexual Abuse</div> <div class="author"> <em>Miranda Wei</em>, Sunny Consolvo, Patrick Gage Kelley, Tadayoshi Kohno, Tara Matthews, Sarah Meiklejohn, Franziska Roesner, Renee Shelby, Kurt Thomas, and Rebecca Umbach </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In USENIX Security Symposium</em>, Aug 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12161" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity24-wei-miranda-understanding.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDvBWDq4seI" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Video</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/usenix24-ibsa-slides.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Slides</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Image-based sexual abuse (IBSA), like other forms of technology-facilitated abuse, is a growing threat to people’s digital safety. Attacks include unwanted solicitations for sexually explicit images, extorting people under threat of leaking their images, or purposefully leaking images to enact revenge or exert control. In this paper, we explore how people seek and receive help for IBSA on social media. Specifically, we identify over 100,000 Reddit posts that engage relationship and advice communities for help related to IBSA. We draw on a stratified sample of 261 posts to qualitatively examine how various types of IBSA unfold, including the mapping of gender, relationship dynamics, and technology involvement to different types of IBSA. We also explore the support needs of victim-survivors experiencing IBSA and how communities help victim-survivors navigate their abuse through technical, emotional, and relationship advice. Finally, we highlight sociotechnical gaps in connecting victim-survivors with important care, regardless of whom they turn to for help.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="wei2024sok" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">SoK (or SoLK?): On the Quantitative Study of Sociodemographic Factors and Computer Security Behaviors</div> <div class="author"> <em>Miranda Wei</em>, Jaron Mink, Yael Eiger, Tadayoshi Kohno, Elissa M.

To more holistically understand relationships between these factors and behaviors, we make two contributions. First, we broadly survey existing scholarship on sociodemographics and secure behavior (151 papers) before conducting a focused literature review of 47 papers to synthesize what is currently known and identify open questions for future research. Second, by incorporating contemporary social and critical theories, we establish guidelines for future studies of sociodemographic factors and security behaviors that address how to overcome common pitfalls. We present a case study to demonstrate our guidelines in action, at-scale, that conduct a measurement study of the relationships between sociodemographics and de-identified, aggregated log data of security and privacy behaviors among 16,829 users on Facebook across 16 countries. Through these contributions, we position our work as a systemization of a lack of knowledge (SoLK). Overall, we find contradictory results and vast unknowns about how identity shapes security behavior. Through our guidelines and discussion, we chart new directions to more deeply examine how and why sociodemographic factors affect security behaviors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="brigham2024violation" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">“Violation of My Body:” Perceptions of AI-generated Non-Consensual (Intimate) Imagery</div> <div class="author"> Grace Brigham, <em>Miranda Wei</em>, Tadayoshi Kohno, and Elissa M.

Respondents indicated strong opposition to creating and, even more so, sharing non-consensually created synthetic content, especially if that content depicts a sexual act. However, seeking out such content appeared more acceptable to some respondents. Attitudes around acceptability varied further based on the hypothetical creator’s relationship to the participant, the respondent’s gender and their attitudes towards sexual consent.

Unfortunately, this “sharenting” can expose children to several online and offline risks. Although researchers have studied sharenting on multiple platforms, sharenting on short-form video platforms like TikTok—where posts can contain detailed information, spread quickly, and spark considerable engagement—is understudied. Thus, we provide a targeted exploration of sharenting on TikTok. We analyzed 328 TikTok videos that demonstrate sharenting and 438 videos where TikTok creators discuss sharenting norms. Our results indicate that sharenting on TikTok indeed creates several risks for children, not only within individual posts but also in broader patterns of sharenting that arise when parents repeatedly use children to generate viral content. At the same time, creators voiced sharenting concerns and boundaries that reflect what has been observed on other platforms, indicating the presence of cross-platform norms. Promisingly, we observed that TikTok users are engaging in thoughtful conversations around sharenting and beginning to shift norms toward safer sharenting. We offer concrete suggestions for designers and platforms based on our findings.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="mink2024its" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">It’s Trying Too Hard To Look Real: Deepfake Moderation Mistakes and Identity-Based Bias</div> <div class="author"> Jaron Mink, <em>Miranda Wei</em>, Collins W.

We conducted a user study (n=695) that investigates how 1) the identity of the profile, 2) whether the moderator shares that identity, and 3) components of a profile shown affect the perceived artificiality of the profile. We find statistically significant biases in people’s moderation of LinkedIn profiles based on all three factors. Further, upon examining how moderators make decisions, we find they rely on mental models of AI and attackers, as well as typicality expectations (how they think the world works). The latter includes reliance on race/gender stereotypes.

To learn how organizations can better protect users, we retrospectively analyzed our university’s vulnerability to credential-guessing attacks across twenty years. Given a list of university usernames, we searched for matches in both data breaches from hundreds of websites and a dozen large compilations of breaches. After cracking hashed passwords and tweaking guesses, we successfully guessed passwords for 32.0% of accounts matched to a university email address in a data breach, as well as 6.5% of accounts where the username (but not necessarily the domain) matched. Many of these accounts remained vulnerable for years after the breached data was leaked, and passwords found verbatim in breaches were nearly four times as likely to have been exploited (i.e., suspicious account activity was observed) than tweaked guesses. Over 70 different data breaches and various username-matching strategies bootstrapped correct guesses. In surveys of 40 users whose passwords we guessed, many users were unaware of the risks to their university account or that their credentials had been breached. This analysis of password reuse at our university provides pragmatic advice for organizations to protect accounts.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="wei2023skilled" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Skilled or Gullible?

We find that stereotype beliefs are significantly correlated with participants’ gender as well as level of sexism, and we delve into the justifications our participants offered for their beliefs. Beyond scientifically studying the existence and prevalence of such stereotypes, we describe potential implications, including biasing crowdworker-faciliated user research.

How can researchers who have little or no knowledge of systems and infrastructures ensure that their data collection source is reliable and maximally available for accessing and storing data? To answer this question, we surveyed 11 HCI researchers. Using the findings from the survey, we developed Styx++—an easy-to-integrate open-source solution that bundles together existing tools and concepts, providing HCI researchers with a reliable distributed system for their database needs. Styx++ is a hybrid solution involving both the Paxos and Chain Replication Protocol, providing strong consistency and high availability to minimize the risks of single-point failures in a traditional database system setup. Our evaluation of Styx++ against benchmark solutions shows promising results of an increase in reliability without substantial performance degradation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="zeng2021polls" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Polls, Clickbait, and Commemorative $2 Bills: Problematic Political Advertising on News and Media Websites around the 2020 U.S. Elections</div> <div class="author"> Eric Zeng, <em>Miranda Wei</em>, Theo Gregersen, Tadayoshi Kohno, and Franziska Roesner </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 21st ACM Internet Measurement Conference</em>, Nov 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3487552.3487850" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/imc21.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IwV1F9E_dw" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Video</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Online advertising can be used to mislead, deceive, and manipulate Internet users, and political advertising is no exception. In this paper, we present a measurement study of online advertising around the 2020 United States elections, with a focus on identifying dark patterns and other potentially problematic content in political advertising. We scraped ad content on 745 news and media websites from six geographic locations in the U.S. from September 2020 to January 2021, collecting 1.4 million ads. We perform a systematic qualitative analysis of political content in these ads, as well as a quantitative analysis of the distribution of political ads on different types of websites. Our findings reveal the widespread use of problematic tactics in political ads, such as bait-and-switch ads formatted as opinion polls to entice users to click, the use of political controversy by content farms for clickbait, and the more frequent occurrence of political ads on highly partisan news websites. We make policy recommendations for online political advertising, including greater scrutiny of non-official political ads and comprehensive standards across advertising platforms.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="stransky2021limited" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">On the Limited Impact of Visualizing Encryption: Perceptions of E2E Messaging Security</div> <div class="author"> Christian Stransky, Dominik Wermke, Johanna Schrader, Nicolas Huaman, Yasemin Acar, Anna Lena Fehlhaber, <em>Miranda Wei</em>, Blase Ur, and Sascha Fahl </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Seventeenth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS 2021)</em>, Nov 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/soups2021-stransky.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Communication tools with end-to-end (E2E) encryption help users maintain their privacy. Although messengers like WhatsApp and Signal bring E2E encryption to a broad audience, past work has documented misconceptions of their security and privacy properties. Through a series of five online studies with 683 total participants, we investigated whether making an app’s E2E encryption more visible improves perceptions of trust, security, and privacy. We first investigated why participants use particular messaging tools, validating a prior finding that many users mistakenly think SMS and e-mail are more secure than E2E-encrypted messengers. We then studied the effect of making E2E encryption more visible in a messaging app. We compared six different text disclosures, three different icons, and three different animations of the encryption process. We found that simple text disclosures that messages are "encrypted" are sufficient. Surprisingly, the icons negatively impacted perceptions. While qualitative responses to the animations showed they successfully conveyed and emphasized "security" and "encryption," the animations did not significantly impact participants’ quantitative perceptions of the overall trustworthiness, security, and privacy of E2E-encrypted messaging. We confirmed and unpacked this result through a validation study, finding that user perceptions depend more on preconceived expectations and an app’s reputation than visualizations of security mechanisms.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="wei2020twitter" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">What Twitter Knows: Characterizing Ad Targeting Practices, User Perceptions, and Ad Explanations Through Users’ Own Twitter Data</div> <div class="author"> <em>Miranda Wei</em>, Madison Stamos, Sophie Veys, Nathan Reitinger, Justin Goodman, Margot Herman, Dorota Filipczuk, Ben Weinshel, Michelle L.

In particular, only a few of the dozens of targeting mechanisms used by major advertising platforms are well understood, and studies examining users’ perceptions of ad targeting often rely on hypothetical situations. Further, it is unclear how well existing transparency mechanisms, from data-access rights to ad explanations, actually serve the users they are intended for. To develop a deeper understanding of the current targeting advertising ecosystem, this paper engages 231 participants’ own Twitter data, containing ads they were shown and the associated targeting criteria, for measurement and user study. We find many targeting mechanisms ignored by prior work — including advertiser-uploaded lists of specific users, lookalike audiences, and retargeting campaigns — are widely used on Twitter. Crucially, participants found these understudied practices among the most privacy invasive. Participants also found ad explanations designed for this study more useful, more comprehensible, and overall more preferable than Twitter’s current ad explanations. Our findings underscore the benefits of data access, characterize unstudied facets of targeted advertising, and identify potential directions for improving transparency in targeted advertising.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="hanson2020taking" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Taking Data Out of Context to Hyper-Personalize Ads: Crowdworkers’ Privacy Perceptions and Decisions to Disclose Private Information</div> <div class="author"> Julia Hanson<sup>*</sup>, <em>Miranda Wei<sup>*</sup></em>, Sophie Veys, Matthew Kugler, Lior Strahilevitz, and Blase Ur </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</em>, Apr 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376415" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/chi20.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/chi20-slides.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Slides</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Data brokers and advertisers increasingly collect data in one context and use it in another. When users encounter a misuse of their data, do they subsequently disclose less information? We report on human-subjects experiments with 25 in-person and 280 online participants. First, participants provided personal information amidst distractor questions. A week later, while participants completed another survey, they received either a robotext or online banner ad seemingly unrelated to the study. Half of the participants received an ad containing their name, partner’s name, preferred cuisine, and location; others received a generic ad. We measured how many of 43 potentially invasive questions participants subsequently chose to answer. Participants reacted negatively to the personalized ad, yet answered nearly all invasive questions accurately. We unpack our results relative to the privacy paradox, contextual integrity, and power dynamics in crowdworker platforms.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div id="weinshel2019oh" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Oh, the Places You’ve Been!

Prior work has shown that existing privacy-protective tools give users only a limited understanding and incomplete picture of online tracking. We present Tracking Transparency, a privacy-preserving browser extension that visualizes examples of long-term, longitudinal information that third-party trackers could have inferred from users’ browsing. The extension uses a client-side topic modeling algorithm to categorize pages that users visit and combines this with data about the web trackers encountered over time to create these visualizations. We conduct a longitudinal field study in which 425 participants use one of six variants of our extension for a week. We find that, after using the extension, participants have more accurate perceptions of the extent of tracking and also intend to take privacy-protecting actions.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="golla2018what" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">"What Was That Site Doing with My Facebook Password?": Designing Password-Reuse Notifications</div> <div class="author"> Maximilian Golla, <em>Miranda Wei</em>, Juliette Hainline, Lydia Filipe, Markus Dürmuth, Elissa Redmiles, and Blase Ur </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security</em>, Oct 2018 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3243734.3243767" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/ccs18.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/ccs18-slides.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Slides</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Password reuse is widespread, so a breach of one provider’s password database threatens accounts on other providers. When companies find stolen credentials on the black market and notice potential password reuse, they may require a password reset and send affected users a notification. Through two user studies, we provide insight into such notifications. In Study 1, 180 respondents saw one of six representative notifications used by companies in situations potentially involving password reuse. Respondents answered questions about their reactions and understanding of the situation. Notifications differed in the concern they elicited and intended actions they inspired. Concerningly, less than a third of respondents reported intentions to change any passwords. In Study 2, 588 respondents saw one of 15 variations on a model notification synthesizing results from Study 1. While the variations’ impact differed in small ways, respondents’ intended actions across all notifications would leave them vulnerable to future password-reuse attacks. We discuss best practices for password-reuse notifications and how notifications alone appear insufficient in solving password reuse.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="wei2018password" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">The Password Doesn’t Fall Far: How Service Influences Password Choice</div> <div class="author"> <em>Miranda Wei</em>, Maximilian Golla, and Blase Ur </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Who Are You?!

But does the type of web service influence how users construct their password? In this paper, we observe how and how often passwords are specific to the services for which they were created. We analyze leaked passwords from five web services. We find that passwords from each service reflect the category of the service, often by including the name or semantic theme of the service. Through a qualitative analysis of passwords, we further identify unique characteristics of the passwords created for each service. Service-specific passwords can reveal other shared interests or demographics of that service’s userbase. This contextual perspective on password creation suggests improvements for site-specific blacklists and password-strength meters.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="abu-salma2018exploring" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Exploring User Mental Models of End-to-End Encrypted Communication Tools</div> <div class="author"> Ruba Abu-Salma, Elissa M.

Unfortunately, users have misconceptions about what this mode does. Many factors likely contribute to these misconceptions. In this paper, we focus on browsers’ disclosures, or their in-browser explanations of private browsing mode. In a 460-participant online study, each participant saw one of 13 different disclosures (the desktop and mobile disclosures of six popular browsers, plus a control). Based on the disclosure they saw, participants answered questions about what would happen in twenty browsing scenarios capturing previously documented misconceptions. We found that browsers’ disclosures fail to correct the majority of the misconceptions we tested. These misconceptions included beliefs that private browsing mode would prevent geolocation, advertisements, viruses, and tracking by both the websites visited and the network provider. Furthermore, participants who saw certain disclosures were more likely to have misconceptions about private browsing’s impact on targeted advertising, the persistence of lists of downloaded files, and tracking by ISPs, employers, and governments.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container"> © Copyright 2026 Miranda Wei. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?2781658a0a2b13ed609542042a859126"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?e0514a05c5c95ac1a93a8dfd5249b92e"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?12775fdf7f95e901d7119054556e495f" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.2/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js" integrity="sha256-MASABpB4tYktI2Oitl4t+78w/lyA+D7b/s9GEP0JOGI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script type="text/javascript">function progressBarSetup(){"max"in document.createElement("progress")?(initializeProgressElement(),$(document).on("scroll",function(){progressBar.attr({value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}),$(window).on("resize",initializeProgressElement)):(resizeProgressBar(),$(document).on("scroll",resizeProgressBar),$(window).on("resize",resizeProgressBar))}function getCurrentScrollPosition(){return $(window).scrollTop()}function initializeProgressElement(){let e=$("#navbar").outerHeight(!0);$("body").css({"padding-top":e}),$("progress-container").css({"padding-top":e}),progressBar.css({top:e}),progressBar.attr({max:getDistanceToScroll(),value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}function getDistanceToScroll(){return $(document).height()-$(window).height()}function resizeProgressBar(){progressBar.css({width:getWidthPercentage()+"%"})}function getWidthPercentage(){return getCurrentScrollPosition()/getDistanceToScroll()*100}const progressBar=$("#progress");window.onload=function(){setTimeout(progressBarSetup,50)};</script> <script src="/assets/js/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js?f40d453793ff4f64e238e420181a1d17"></script> <script>addBackToTop();</script> </body> </html>
