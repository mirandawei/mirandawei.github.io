I'm an incoming postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP) at Princeton University, where I'll be working with Jonathan Mayer. In fall 2026, I will start as an Assistant Professor of Computer and Communication Sciences at EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) in Lausanne, Switzerland.

***Interested in doing a PhD with me?***
I'm hiring for PhD positions to start at EPFL in fall 2026! 
You should apply through EPFL's [EDIC application](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-how-to-apply/) - the deadline is December 15, 2025. 
I will review all applications that mention me in the statement of purpose.

I earned my PhD from the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington in the [Security & Privacy Research Lab](https://seclab.cs.washington.edu/), while affiliated with the [Tech Policy Lab](https://techpolicylab.uw.edu/). 
Broadly, I study the role of computing and information technologies in perpetuating individual and societal harm, with particular attention to contemporary sociocultural lenses and emerging technologies.
My research interests lie at the intersections of security and privacy (S&P), human-computer interaction (HCI), and feminist science and technology studies (STS).
I publish in leading security, privacy, and HCI venues, including USENIX Security, IEEE S&P, CHI, SOUPS, IMC, and CCS.

My recent work focused on addressing online abuse as a new frontier of S&P challenges in three key directions: 
1. characterizing emerging digital safety threats, such as [synthetic nonconsensual explicit imagery](https://mirandawei.com/assets/pdf/chi25.pdf) ("deepfake nudes") and [interpersonal surveillance](https://mirandawei.com/assets/pdf/soups22.pdf); 
2. evaluating existing support for online abuse, such as for [image-based sexual abuse](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity24-wei-miranda-understanding.pdf) and [online hate and harassment](https://mirandawei.com/assets/pdf/chi23.pdf); and
3. developing conceptual tools to bridge S&P and HCI towards societally informed S&P research, such as by centering [gender](https://mirandawei.com/assets/pdf/sp23.pdf) and other [sociodemographic factors](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec24summer-prepub-341-wei-miranda.pdf).

My PhD was co-advised by Professors [Franzi Roesner](https://www.franziroesner.com/) and [Yoshi Kohno](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yoshi/). I have also interned with Google's Security, Privacy, and Abuse Prevention teams, where I was mentored by Drs. [Kurt Thomas](https://research.google/people/kurtthomas/?&type=google) and [Sunny Consolvo](https://research.google/people/sunnyconsolvo/).
Before starting my PhD, I worked with Professor [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/) in the [Security, Usability, & Privacy Education & Research Group](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/index.html) (SUPERgroup) at the University of Chicago, where I investigated privacy perceptions of online advertising as well as password and security notification usability.

I recieved a B.A. in Political Science and Computer Science from the University of Chicago. I was a researcher with the [Chicago Project on Security & Threats](https://cpost.uchicago.edu/) (CPOST), where I contributed to the first worldwide database on suicide attacks and led research teams monitoring and analyzing militant group propoganda. My bachelor's thesis on the Islamic State's audio propaganda received departmental honors. 
As an undergraduate, I also spent a year directly enrolled at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), where I enjoyed courses in international relations and international law.
